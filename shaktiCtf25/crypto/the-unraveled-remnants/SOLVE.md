## 🎯 Synopsis {#synopsis}

-   **Challenge Description**: A fragment of an ancient communication protocol was uncovered during a recent server excavation. Though partially erased, the remnants were preserved through layers of obscure glyphs and forgotten encipherments. Those who tried to suppress it left behind traces—twisted through classical rearrangement and an old military cipher. The key they used to distort it is the same as the script in which the message was first concealed. Can you reverse the damage and recover what was nearly lost?

(P.S. Once you retrieve the final message, submit it in all lowercase letters, replace spaces with underscores, and wrap it with shaktictf{}. Example: If your decoded message is HELLOWORLD, submit it as: shaktictf{hello_world})
