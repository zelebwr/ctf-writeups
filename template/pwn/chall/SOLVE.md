## üîé Reconnaissance & Initial Analysis {#reconnaissance--initial-analysis}

_Initial steps taken to understand the challenge. What kind of file is it? What service is running? What are the first thoughts?_

For example:

-   Ran `file` and `strings` on the provided binary.
-   Connected to the `netcat` instance to observe the initial interaction.
-   Opened the web page and inspected the source code and network traffic.

```bash
# Example commands
file challenge_binary
strings challenge_binary | head
```

---

## üîì Vulnerability Exploitation {#vulnerability-exploitation}

_The step-by-step process of finding and exploiting the vulnerability. Break this down into logical stages._

### Stage 1: [Name of the First Step]

_Detailed explanation of the first part of the exploit process. You can reference a source like this.[^1]_

!!! tip "Key Insight"
_This is where the "aha!" moment happened. What was the key piece of information or technique that cracked this stage?_

### Stage 2: [Name of the Second Step]

_Continuing the exploitation process... You can reference another source like this.[^2]_

!!! warning "Potential Rabbit Hole"
_Did you try something that didn't work? Documenting dead ends is just as important as the solution path. It shows a thorough process._

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Final Payload / Script {#final-payload--script}

_The final script or one-liner used to retrieve the flag._

```python
# solve.py
from pwn import *

# Your final script here
p = remote('example.com', 1337)
p.sendline(b'payload')

flag = p.recvall()
log.info(f"Flag: {flag.decode()}")
```

---

## üèÅ Flag {#flag}

The flag obtained after successful exploitation.

```
ctf{[FLAG_HERE]}
```

---

## üß† Lessons Learned {#lessons-learned}

_This is one of the most important sections. What did you learn from this challenge?_

-   Learned about a specific cryptographic vulnerability like [Vulnerability Name].
-   Gained experience with a new tool like `[Tool Name]`.
-   Understood the importance of sanitizing user input to prevent [Attack Type].

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation {#mitigation}

_How could this vulnerability be fixed in a real-world application?_

-   **Input Validation**: The server should properly validate and sanitize all input received from the client.
-   **Using Secure Libraries**: The application should use up-to-date and secure libraries for handling cryptographic operations instead of rolling its own.
-   **Principle of Least Privilege**: The service should run with the minimum permissions necessary.
